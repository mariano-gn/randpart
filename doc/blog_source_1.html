Hello all!
&nbsp;
This time I want to begin a series of articles related to a little project I worked on last weeks. It's all inspired by a section on the book <a href="http://www.essentialmath.com/book.htm">Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications</a>, in which they talk about spherical and disc sampling.
&nbsp;
The general idea is that you want to generate initial directions for particles on a particle system, and what you do is obtain random points on the surface of the unit sphere (or circumferece of the unit disc, depending on how many dimensions you need). In the book they show 4 different methods and prove which of them are not right. I wanted to experiment with the random library from C++ and (initially) found interesting to present a visual demo of this 4 methods that were better than just a black and white picture.
&nbsp;
I came up with the idea of generating particles using this 4 methods and the apply color to them based on some density function, so to prove that having a more homogeneous surface in the sphere was a visual proof of the effectiveness of the method. In the same way, founding some type of pattern in the colors would be a proof of a problem.
&nbsp;
After having accomplished this initial objective I though of playing with the lifetime of the particles, and having some interaction, testing how many particles I could handle, ways of optimizing that number, and then time passed and I didn't write anything here to show :P
&nbsp;
Lets amend that now, but before we dive in, as I said, I wanted to use the random C++ library (from the STL) and I won't put doubts on the randomness of the numbers generated. Once assumed that, 2 of the four methods will have flaws that will make them generate an incorrect result. 
<h1>Generating random points</h1>
The book goes to show 4 different ways of achieving this, that I called <code>RANDOM_CARTESIAN_NAIVE</code>, <code>RANDOM_CARTESIAN_DISCARD</code>, <code>RANDOM_SPHERICAL_NAIVE</code> and <code>RANDOM_SPHERICAL_LATITUDE</code>. We'll go one by one with extracts of the demo.
<h2>RANDOM_CARTESIAN_NAIVE</h2>
In this case, (according to the article the first thing you can think of) you obtain the points in the unit sphere by doing 2 things:
<ul>
    <li>Generate 3 random numbers between 0 and 1, corresponding to the coordinates of x, y and z.</li>
    <li>Normalize your vector, so that the point is effectively on the surface of the unit sphere</li>
</ul>
More or less, something like that:
[code language="cpp"]
std::mt19937 g_generator{ std::random_device{}() };
std::uniform_real_distribution<float> g_dis01(0.f, 1.f);

struct vec3 {
    vec3(float ix, float iy, float iz) : x(ix), y(iy), z(iz) {}
    float x, y, z;
    float len() {
        return std::sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z);
    }
    void normalize(vec3& v) {
        const auto l = v.len();
        if (l != 0.f) {
            x /= l;
            y /= l;
            z /= l;
        } else {
            x = y = z = 0.f;
        }
    }
};

vec3 get_random_cartesian_naive() {
    // Generate coordinates.
    vec3 ret {
         g_dis01(g_generator),
         g_dis01(g_generator),
         g_dis01(g_generator)
    };
    
    // Normalize vector.
    ret.normalize();
    return ret;
}
[/code]
Only by looking at the code, nothing seems wrong, but visualizing the result proves something isn't right:
<INSERT RANDOM_CARTESIAN_NAIVE IMG></INSERT>
What's wrong?
&nbsp;
The problem is the normalization operation, to explain it, look at what's visualized when using the points without the call to normalize: 
<INSERT RANDOM_CARTESIAN_CUBE IMG></INSERT>
